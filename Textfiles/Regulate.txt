I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brothas and said "damn, what's next?"
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I besta pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happened in my home town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate
