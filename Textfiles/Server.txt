In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or 
devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model, and a single overall 
computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, 
often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation 
for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. 
A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. 
Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, 
and application servers.
