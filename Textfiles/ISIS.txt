The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as the Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria or Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) and by its Arabic
language acronym Daesh is a Salafi jihadist militant group and former
unrecognised proto-state that follows a fundamentalist, Wahhabi, and heterodox
doctrine of Sunni Islam. ISIL gained global priminence in early 2014 when it
drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in its Western Iraq offensice,
followed by its capture of Mosul and the Sinjar massacre. This group has been
designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and many individual
countries. ISIL is widely known for its videos of beheadings and other types
of executions of both soldiers and civilians, including journalists and air
workers, and its destruction of cultural heritage sites. The United Nations
holds ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes and Amnesty
International has charged the group with ethnic cleansing on a "historic scale"
in northern Iraq.
