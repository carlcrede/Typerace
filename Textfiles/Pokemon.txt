I wanna be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them all is my real test,
To train them is my cause,

I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside!

Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me
I know its my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
(Po-ke-mon) Gotta catch 'em all
