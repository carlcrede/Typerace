I want to be the very best, like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test,
to train them is my cause. I will travel across the land, searching far and wide.
Teach pokémon to understand, the power that's inside.
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all. It's you and me. I know it's my destiny.
Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend. In a world we must defend.
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all. A heart so true. Our courage will pull
us through. You teach me, and I'll teach you. Pokémon!
Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all.
